 README

Setting up for Project
   Start by creating a port in windows defender so it does not block the connection, you can do this by
   Going to Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, click Inbound Rules, add a new rule port with 
   whatever port you wish to use.

Running the Program
   You can run the program in Visual Studio, this is a C# code. The code works in my computer but it is 
   not stable. Sometime, it doesn't work. We tried to fix it but found no error. We ran the code with a breakpoint to find an error
   but found nothing.
